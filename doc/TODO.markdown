 To Do
=======

 In Process
------------

- Removing the various bizarre functionality links.


 Definitely
------------

- TESTS!! (Probably incorporating Aslak Hellesoy's first.)
- Reverting commits.
- Deleting and renaming pages.
- Use user info when committing if authentication enabled.
- Refine XHTML, easier "branding" through configuration.
- Creating subdirectories.
- Customise commit messages etc.
- Restricting log output e.g. to start from some defined commit.


 Probably
----------

- Add branching support back.


 Maybe
-------

- More options for mapping URLs to the filesystem.
- Rethink the URL resource "namespacing."
- Real user accounts, possibly even somehow discerned from Git.
- Read-only, no Git required.
