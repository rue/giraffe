= SOON
  * repo stats/info/maintenance page
  * deleting pages 
  * pushing repo from web interface

= CHACON IDEAS
  * tagging
  * file attachments
  * inter-branch links
  * merge conflict resolution
  * git-less version (read-only)
  * track which branched from which
  * push?
  * cherry-picked branches (read-tree/write-tree)
  * users (email/name/ip - use for commits)
  
= LATER/MAYBE
  * outliner functionality
  * menubar item launcher (like Instiki back in the day)
  * RubyCocoa GUI
  
= DONE
  * working launchd plist
  * in-place editing
  * fix duplication of routes/methods to accommodate file extensions
  * "append selected text/link to page" bookmarklet (shamelessly cribbed 
    from Trsly/Instapaper) 
  * allow "code pages" by supporting file extensions, applying syntax
    highlighting (removed March 14 2008 by al3x, may add back in)
  * next/previous commit links on pages
  * pretty stylesheet
  
= PROBABLY NOT
  * Shoes GUI: Shoes is still pretty immature, ex: all paths are relative 
    to the `shoes` binary making requires a pain, etc.
